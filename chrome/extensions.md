# My chrome extensions

Chrome is my favorite web browser. As a web developer, life is so easy with chrome in hand. `Vimium` extension let me use `vim` inside the browser. It's much more efficient and happier after using it. Besides `Vimium`, many other extensions are very useful. Here are the extensions I am using:

+ Save to Pocket
+ Proxy SwitchyOmega
+ Vimium
+ Google Translate
+ Adblock Plus
+ Google Calender
+ English dictionary translate pronunciation
