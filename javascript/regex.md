## Test

I was browsing [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3480771/how-do-i-check-if-string-contains-substring/3480785#3480785) and noticed this javascript code:

```javascript
    if (/yes/i.test(str))
```

so to test if a string contains a substring, we can use such `test` method, `i` here just means `ignore case`.
