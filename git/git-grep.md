# Git Grep

To make use of this repository, one command I try to master but lazy to learn it `grep`, I have found that `git` has this command `git grep`, using `-E` flag, I could search multiple keywords in a file. For instance,

```git
git grep -E "python|Filter"
```

`regex` is very powerful, I have to learn more command about it.
