Everytime I clone a project and want to push, the same problem of requiring inputing username and password always bothers me. I wouldn't remember it, and always google it. It's easy to google the ansewer, but I think this `til` should become a cheatsheet.

```
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
```
instead of
```
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com:username/repo.git
```
